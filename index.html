												</h3>
												<p>In May of 2021 I graduated from the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), Completing the accelerated Masters program for the Economic Policy Analysis degree. In the process, I also obtained a B.S. in Financial Economics and a B.A. in Sociology. 
													My education and early work experience centered around developing the core competencies needed to understand public policy, administration, quantitative research, data analytics, and financial management. I have received extensive training with using various statistical packages and have even been able to conduct my 
													own empirical research on topics pertaining to Maryland zoning policy, U.S. IPO's, and international financial literacy.

												<h3>Core Focus and Goals</h3>
												<p>While at times it may feel unrealistic, I am most passionate about seeing a world that does not yet exist. As a young Black man from Chicago Illionis, building a world that provides love, happiness, and safety for my family and community has always been on the forefront of my mind.
													I was too young too articulate this growing up, but I eventually to learn that building this 
                                                     type of world would require me to develop a diverse range of technical and interpesonal skills that not only allow me to be a strong leader, but allow me to be the type of leader that builds other strong leaders. 
													My core goal is to build stronger, healthier, and more poltically engaged communities by leveraging the power of data, policy, and relational organizing in my personal and professional work. For more information about me

												<h3>Professional Experience</h3>
												<p>Throughout my early professional career, I have had the chance to work with many different organizations that have helped me grow as a professional and an individual. 
													As a graduate resarcher at UMBC, I was able to develop extensive knowledge around data systems and research, as well as getting the chance to develop my own research around the effects of zoning policy in the state of Maryland. Some of my most transformational experiences have come from my work as a non-profit community organizer.  
													As a community organizer, I have not only been able to co-found a 501-c3 organization that works to improve governance within Baltimore City, but have also worked alongside hundreds of local and national organizations to manage issue-based political campaigns, 
													coordinate large-scale research & fundraising projects,
													and develop programs that educate millions of people on how to shift systems and policies in their own community. For more Information about my work experience <a href="https://jjustin1.github.io/jjustin1.githubresume.io/"> click here</a>

												<h3>Core Skills</h3>
												Being a student and Non-Profit organizer have given me a diverse set of skills around political organizing, data analysis, finance, and organizational management.

												As a graduate resarcher, I have had over 2 years of experience with using data analytics software such as R, STATA, MySQL, SPSS, QGIS, Github, VisualStudio, Python, and CSS.
