										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic08(2).jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p = font-size:medium>My name is Justin Johnson, and I am a community organizer and student working in Baltimore Maryland. As a 
										a young man from Chicago Illinois, I have had many personal and professional experiences that have given me a 
										wide range of skills and talents that have greatly helped me in my early career. I wanted to create this portfolio to share 
										a little bit about me, my work, and the value I can bring to future partners and employers that I work with. 
										My hope is that this portfolio can not just show the various projects I have worked on throughout the years, but 
										also to demonstrate the passion and dedication I have for the work I do. </br>
								       
									<br />
                                        I have spent the majority of my early professional career developing skills and experiences 
										that have prepared me for a role in building and managing organizations that can fulfill the needs
										 that any business or community has for safety, resources, and political 
										 representation. As a college student, I worked to obtain a masterâ€™s degree in Economic Policy 
										 while also obtaining undergraduate degrees in 
										 Finance, Economics, and Sociology. 
										 I have conducted multiple empirical studies on various policy issues regarding zoning regulation,
										  business development, and wealth inequality; 
										 having received several certifications in a variety of statistical software and programming applications in the process. 
										 My academic goal is to use these skills and experiences to deepen my understanding of our political, economic, 
										 and technological ecosystems in order to master my skills for navigating public administration, 
										 performing data analysis, and managing organizations. </br>

								<br />
                                         In my professional work as a campaign organizer, I use my unique capabilities to leverage technological, financial, 
                                        and social influences in order to better improve the conditions of under-served and marginalized communities across our country.
										 As the co-founder of a 501-C3 organization, I have traveled across the United States base-building with an international network of leaders, 
										 scholars, policymakers, and other professionals
										  to coordinate and execute multiple political and electoral campaigns designed to build local political power and shape legislation that 
										  combats social inequality. 
										  Working together, our organizations have been able to leverage millions of personal and political 
										  relationships that have allowed us to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars
										   towards sponsoring legislation, coordinate various campaigns, provide mutual aid, and help sustain 
										   and train other organizations who are committed to doing similar work.
										    Not only has this work allowed me to express my passion for creativity and community, but it has also prepared me 
											for navigating the complex power dynamics inherent in any public or private organization I choose to work with. </br>
                                        
							<br />	My goal is to use my passion for communication, base building, economics, and policy analysis to better serve my community 
										and leave a positive impact on those I work alongside. As a student, organizer, friend, and son, I strive to navigate all 
										career paths that come before me with rigor, precision, and professionalism. </br>
